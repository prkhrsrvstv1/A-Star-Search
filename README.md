# A* Search

## 8_puzzle_modified_a_star.cpp
Uses a modified version of the A* Search Algorithm that expands the nodes using a BFS traversal upto a fixed depth.
Compares "Manhattan Distance" and "Mismatch Count" heuristics for a mutiple BFS depths, for multiple trials.
Results will list :
- Time taken for the trial
- Number of nodes expanded
- Maximum length of the fringe
- Length of optimal solution
- Optimal path (if user chooses)
Option to print the optimal paths
For regular A* search, depth = 1 can be used.
