# A* Search

## 8_puzzle_a_star.cpp
Solves the 8-Puzzle Problem using the A* Search Algorithm.
The implementation has an option to choose between the Manhattan Distance and Out-of-place-tiles heuristics to estimate the remaining path length.

## [Future] 8_puzzle_modified_a_star.cpp
Uses a modified version of the A* Search Algorithm that expands the nodes using a BFS traversal upto a fixed depth.
